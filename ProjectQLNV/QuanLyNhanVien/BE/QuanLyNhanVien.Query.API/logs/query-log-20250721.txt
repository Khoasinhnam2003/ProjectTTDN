2025-07-21 09:42:35.812 +07:00 [WRN] The query uses a row limiting operator ('Skip'/'Take') without an 'OrderBy' operator. This may lead to unpredictable results. If the 'Distinct' operator is used after 'OrderBy', then make sure to use the 'OrderBy' operator after 'Distinct' as the ordering would otherwise get erased.

2025-07-21 09:42:42.948 +07:00 [WRN] Compiling a query which loads related collections for more than one collection navigation, either via 'Include' or through projection, but no 'QuerySplittingBehavior' has been configured. By default, Entity Framework will use 'QuerySplittingBehavior.SingleQuery', which can potentially result in slow query performance. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2134277 for more information. To identify the query that's triggering this warning call 'ConfigureWarnings(w => w.Throw(RelationalEventId.MultipleCollectionIncludeWarning))'.
